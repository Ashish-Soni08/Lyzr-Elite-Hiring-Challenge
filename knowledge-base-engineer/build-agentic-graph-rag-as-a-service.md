# Build Agentic Graph RAG as a Service

This document outlines the challenge for building an Agentic Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system as a service.

## Challenge Description

Implement a scalable and efficient Agentic Graph RAG system that can be deployed as a service. The system should leverage graph databases for knowledge representation and agentic capabilities for enhanced retrieval and generation.

## Key Components:

*   **Graph Database Integration:** Utilize a graph database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) to store and manage complex relationships within the knowledge base.
*   **Agentic Retrieval:** Develop intelligent agents that can traverse the graph, identify relevant information, and perform multi-hop reasoning for retrieval.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Integrate large language models (LLMs) with the retrieved information to generate accurate, coherent, and contextually relevant responses.
*   **Service Deployment:** Package the solution as a deployable service (e.g., Docker container, Kubernetes deployment) with appropriate APIs for interaction.
*   **Scalability and Performance:** Design the system to handle high query loads and large knowledge bases efficiently.

## Deliverables:

*   Source code for the Agentic Graph RAG service.
*   Documentation on setup, deployment, and API usage.
*   Demonstration of the system's capabilities with example queries.

## Evaluation Criteria:

*   Effectiveness of graph traversal and agentic retrieval.
*   Quality and relevance of generated responses.
*   Scalability and performance of the service.
*   Code quality, documentation, and ease of deployment.
