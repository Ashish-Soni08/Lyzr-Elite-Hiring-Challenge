# Relational Database to Graph RAG Transformation

This document outlines the challenge of transforming data from a relational database into a format suitable for a Graph RAG system.

## Challenge Description

Develop a robust and efficient pipeline to extract data from a given relational database schema, transform it into a graph structure, and integrate it into a Graph RAG system. The goal is to leverage the rich relationships in graph data for improved retrieval and generation capabilities.

## Key Steps:

*   **Schema Analysis:** Understand the relational database schema and identify entities and relationships that can be represented as nodes and edges in a graph.
*   **Data Extraction:** Extract data from the relational database using appropriate querying techniques.
*   **Graph Transformation:** Design and implement a mapping strategy to convert relational tables and their joins into a graph data model (nodes, edges, properties).
*   **Graph Database Loading:** Load the transformed graph data into a graph database (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB).
*   **RAG Integration:** Ensure the graph data is structured and indexed in a way that is optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, allowing LLMs to effectively query and utilize the graph for contextual information.

## Deliverables:

*   Scripts or code for schema analysis, data extraction, and graph transformation.
*   Documentation of the mapping strategy and graph schema.
*   Instructions for loading data into a graph database.
*   Demonstration of how the transformed graph data enhances RAG queries.

## Evaluation Criteria:

*   Accuracy and completeness of the relational-to-graph transformation.
*   Efficiency of the data pipeline.
*   Clarity of the graph schema and mapping documentation.
*   Demonstrated improvement in RAG system performance using the graph data.
